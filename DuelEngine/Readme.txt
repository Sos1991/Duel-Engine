So you are now here with the newly arranged Duel Engine, 
just go .\Project\[your vs version]\BuildExternal_xxx.bat and run DuelEnginel.sln

[notice]
By default the solution don't have any .user files, so you need to modified the running project [DemoFrame], in Properties->
Debug->Working Directory, set "$(ProjectDir)..\..\Resource"

have fun!
